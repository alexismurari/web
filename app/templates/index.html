            <h3>Mushroom genus identification and classification (C)</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Worked in a team of 4 for a Machine Learning project which detects and classify mushrooms</p>
            <iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NEfr-MpBYrA"> </iframe>
            <p>On a walk in nature, one often finds a host of unfamiliar mushrooms tucked between the leaves. The goal of this project is to determine the genus of a mushroom based on its appearance. If we know the genus, we would have a lot less to search through to determine the mushroom’s exact identity, without the help of an expert. </p>
            <p> There are many visual characteristics that distinguish types of mushrooms from each other, but it is not feasible to recognize them with conventional algorithms given the variation across samples. </p>
            <p> Google reverse-image search can achieve our goal to some degree. However, it does not specialize in this task and possesses a few major shortfalls. Firstly, it sometimes goes no further than recognizing the image as “wild mushroom”. Moreover, its use requires an internet connection -- not always available outdoors -- whereas our model can perform its calculations locally. </p>

            <h3>Memory game on a FPGA board (Verilog) </h3>
            <p> <img src="static/images/memory.png" alt="" id = "memory"> </p> 
            <p> For this project, we designed and implemented a memory game on the FPGA board. We wanted to create a game that would be simple to understand and competitive between different players who would play the game. The concept of the game was to have players determine and remember a sequence of symbols that would increase in length as the game went on. A timer would be implemented to keep a record of the player’s score, which they could use to challenge others with or improve themselves with more practice.</p>

            <p>The wavechord detects your hand position above the Kinect and maps your position to a corresponding chord on the piano. Currently, the synthesizer generates I, IV, and V major chords for simplicity.</p>
